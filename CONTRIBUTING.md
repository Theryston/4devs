## Pull request

### Step 1: Fork

Fork the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/Theryston/4devs) and clone your fork locally.

```text
git clone https://github.com/{username}/4devs.git
cd node
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Theryston/4devs.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Step 2: Branch

As a best practice to keep your development environment as organized as
possible, create local branches to work within. These should also be created
directly off of the upstream default branch.

```text
git checkout -b my-branch -t upstream/HEAD
```

### Step 3: Code

The vast majority of pull requests opened against the `Theryston/4devs`
repository includes changes to one or more of the following:

- the JavaScript code contained in the `lib` directory
- the documentation in `README.md`
- tests within the `__test__` directory.
- examples within the `examples` directory.

If you are modifying code, be sure to create tests and documentation for new features or bug fixes (if to be a bug fix, is not required to write the documentation).
